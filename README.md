## What's a Flashcard?

Quoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard)
> A flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard bears a question on one side and an answer on the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards can be virtual (part of a flashcard software), or physical.

The main goal of this app is to help users memorize vocabulary using Flashcards.

Imagine you want to memorize the English word [Banana](https://unsplash.com/photos/Kl3467edwsE). You can create a Flashcard with a banana picture, using the word `banana` as the title.
So each time you open that Flashcard you see a picture of a banana associated with the word `banana`.
Eventually you can add an optional description to help you memorize the word.

That's why each Flashcard has an image, a title and an optional description.

## OK, what should I do with those Flashcards?

You repeat them, that's the point! Because practice makes perfect :rocket:!

Each Flashcard belongs to a Directory. As you download the app for the first time you get a default Directory to store your Flashcards. But it's highly recommended that you create your own Directories based on which type of Flashcards you are going to store in those.
A Directory named `Fruits` can contain Flashcards of fruits, for instance.

In each Directory you can add Flashcards or repeat your existing Flashcards.  
 
If you have more than 4 Flashcards, you can take a quiz to test your knowledge. At the end of each quiz, you will see your results which gives you a feedback of your learning level.
